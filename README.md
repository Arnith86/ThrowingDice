# Project Overview

This is a remade version of my first programming assignment, which was originally written procedurally in C++.  
I recreated it to see how much I have improved since then. 
This time, I chose to take a different approach by implementing it with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#.
I am quite pleased with the result, though I am considering making a GUI version.

The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/Arnith86/TrowingDice/blob/master/Assignment1Original.cpp).
